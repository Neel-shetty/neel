  <h1>My Linux Experience</h1>
  <p id="time"></p>
  <p>
    A narrative that unfolds from my early encounters with Ubuntu in school to
    the unexpected dual-booting trials and, eventually, a switch to Arch
    Linux.<br />It will be quite unstructured but hey it's going to be a good
    read.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-1-why-does-the-school-use-this-shitty-ubuntu-os">
    Stage 1 - Why does the school use this shitty Ubuntu OS??
  </h2>

  <p>
    My first exposure to Linux was in my school around 7th or 8th grade where we
    had a pc with Ubuntu installed (lets ignore android for now, ik it uses the
    Linux kernel). We used it rarely for some videos and notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was quite good with pc's compared to my peers so i was assigned as the guy
    who turned on the pc and used it. But hey, whenever i was called to help
    with an issue about it, I was useless, Ubuntu felt alien since most of my
    windows experience wasn't applicable here. At this point I didn't know that
    Ubuntu was a Linux distribution, but i knew had heard the name linux from
    idk where.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't have to say it but the random issues and the inexperience definitely
    left a bad taste in my mouth.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-2-how-do-i-run-cc-programs-on-my-phone">
    Stage 2 - How do i run C/C++ programs on my phone??
  </h2>

  <p>
    The next time i came across Linux was when i was getting into programming
    and my 10 year old windows xp pc stopped working all of a sudden in 11th
    grade.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came across a few apps where you could run basic c programs but they felt
    quite limiting. Luckily, i ended up finding termux and managed to run my
    code on it. Yet, i still didn't know that i was using Linux.
  </p>

  <p>
    I connected a keyboard to my phone and started out learning C++ and used it
    for a month or two, at which point i felt limited by termux again due to me
    not knowing Linux. Thinking back right now, i could have done everything i
    wanted to in termux.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-3-kali-linux-is-for-da-hackerss">
    Stage 3 - Kali Linux is for da hackerss!
  </h2>

  <p>
    Since termux was "limiting" i bought a new laptop, which of course ran
    windows 10 (also stopped learning C++ and became 3D graphic designer for 2
    years instead because i couldn't set vscode up to run it ðŸ«¡).
  </p>

  <p>
    I had hacked my neighbours WiFi (with permission of course ;) ) back in 6th
    grade, but fortunately they changed the password now. I wanted it back, but
    the simple old hacking methods and tools didn't work anymore.
  </p>

  <p>
    I start googling "How to Hack WiFi" on YouTube like everyone has at some
    point, and ended up hearing about Kali Linux. I followed a few guides, setup
    Kali Linux in virtual box, used the WiFi dongle from my 10yo pc, copy pasted
    a few commands from the guide and learnt WiFi hacking using Kali for real
    this time. At this point, i knew what Linux was and was capable enough to
    use it by googling my way around. But i never considered using it as an
    actual OS since it looked bad and i had no reason to switch.
  </p>

  <p>
    During lock down, I continued to use Kali to attend my online classes.
    Because, my college used to track if i am active on the chrome tab and
    notified it to the teachers. So using it everyday for simple tasks such as
    web browsing did help with familiarising myself with Linux. Yet i didn't
    know the concepts of distribution's or anything about the Linux command
    line.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-4-wait-i-had-dual-booted-ubuntu">
    Stage 4 - Wait i had dual-booted Ubuntu?
  </h2>

  <p>
    After my unsuccessful business venture in graphic design XD , i decided to
    get back to learning to code. I took it up seriously this time and did learn
    it. Over the past 2 years i had familiarised myself well with Linux and
    watching SomeOrdinaryGamers's Linux videos were quite informative and it
    gave it a good look into Linux land, and now i began to see many people use
    it for coding in tutorials and other places.
  </p>

  <p>
    I finally took the time to research and learn what linux is, and felt like i
    should give it a try due to windows being a pain in the ass over the years.I
    chose Ubuntu as my distribution due to my familiarity and its popularity,
    and dual booted it with windows.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was actually pretty good to use, had to google to do the most basic stuff
    though. i used it for normal usage and windows for gaming. But whenever i
    found myself doing a task which felt very hard to do on linux (such as
    formatting a pendrive lol) i would switch to windows, do my work and switch
    back to ubuntu. App compatibility was quite an issue too since i used many
    proprietary apps and didn't know how to get them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This process of switching back and forth was quite tedious. So once i
    switched to windows i would just stay on it for a few days. This went on for
    a while then i forgot that i had Ubuntu installed and started using windows
    always. In the end i had to delete Ubuntu since it was taking up my precious
    SSD storage space.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-5-termux-is-linux">Stage 5 - Termux is Linux?!</h2>

  <p>
    Armed with my new knowledge from using Ubuntu, I realised that termux is
    basically Linux and i can use it to code. At this point i used to make
    react-native android apps using javascript. I setup neovim as the text
    editor, synced my projects using git and started to code on the go using
    termux. It felt amazing that i had a more powerful machine than my 13yo
    windows xp pc in my pocket, with the freedom to do whatever i want (at least
    somewhat).
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though its not the most convenient setup, it was pretty useful and
    better than scrolling Instagram reels in my free time and while travelling.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had also been using WSL(windows subsystem for Linux) for a few things in
    Linux coz some open source projects didnt support windows for development.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-6-gimme-back-my-storage-windows">
    Stage 6 - gimme back my storage windows ðŸ”«
  </h2>

  <p>
    A year had passed since i dual booted ubuntu, I was all fine in windows
    world doing my work being ignorant. But something was building up, my
    windows experience began to diminish over time and i had more and more
    reasons to switch to linux. I eventually got serious about privacy so i
    started switching to open source alternatives where ever possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows used to fill up my SSD storage and i would have 10 GB left, i would
    find and delete a few stuff and make 20GB free but it would go back to 10GB
    in a few days or weeks. This was tedious and storing everything on my hard
    drive felt slow and bad. This was the final nail in the coffin for windows.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got frustrated to the point that i came in one fine evening from an exam i
    had, and instantly wiped my windows and installed Ubuntu on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the switch was made and there was no going back, for i had ditched
    windows forever. With no option left, i had to learn to do everything on
    linux.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be honest, it felt pretty easy and normal to use ubuntu this time,
    everything worked, i wasn't scared of terminal anymore. I spent around 2
    months on Ubuntu and it was pretty great. Except for gaming, well most of
    the games worked fine due to vavle's involvement in proton and steam deck
    being popular.
  </p>

  <p>
    But initially it was hard to figure out how to play pirated games on ubuntu
    since i could not find any good guides on it, most guides didn't work and it
    was confusing. i didn't understand the concept of wine prefix, wine runner,
    etc. but with trial and error overtime i did manage to get a few games
    working without any issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got curious about customising and i installed KDE plasma in ubuntu and
    didn't like it so i uninstalled, doing so i ended up breaking my gnome
    dark/light mode setting. A few apps such as nautilus(files) app didn't have
    a dark/light mode option in setting, it got it from the gnome setting which
    was broken. This felt quite jank and made the experience worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to try hyprland since most of r/unixporn was filled with cool
    setups using hyprland. But i learnt that its hard to set it up in ubuntu.
  </p>

  <p>
    During this time i got into linux youtube and started to keep in touch with
    the community and the developments happening in the space. Learnt a lot from
    this and was well informed about linux by this point. I didn't want to
    distro hop but i knew that ubuntu wasnt the answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall it was a great experience and linux wasn't just an operating system
    anymore, it was a hobby. It also helped me with setting up servers since
    they basically run linux which felt like home to me.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-stage-7-i-use-arch-btw">Stage 7 - I use arch btw</h2>

  <p>
    At this point I was ready to switch distro's, but still wasn't sure to which
    one i wanted.
  </p>

  <p>
    I installed arch linux in a virtual machine and followed the guide on arch
    wiki and was able to set it up pretty easily. I wasn't as hard as the memes
    made it look.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also gave fedora a try in a vm since it had more up to date packages
    compared to Ubuntu, ofcourse i just ended up experiencing gnome again and
    didn't get to know fedora.
  </p>

  <p>
    So i backed up my files and switched to arch linux finally using the
    archinstall script so that i don't mess things up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially many features that i had on Ubuntu was not there on arch, but all
    i had to do was some googling and install a package to make it work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I liked the went with gnome initially for the familiarity and then installed
    hyprland too (finally!).
  </p>

  <p>
    Surprisingly, I had no issues running games on arch. The only games which
    didn't work were the competitive online games which i hate with a passion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using arch made me learn much more about linux as an OS and all the things
    which make it work.
  </p>

  <p>
    By this point i was totally into the linux ecosystem and kept exploring new
    things.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know, i dont have much to say about this stage except that I used
    linux without any issues for the first time.(I did nuke my desktop
    environment twice but managed to fix it)
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn't afraid of messing things up anymore, since i knew i can fix almost
    anything that happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'd say arch linux isn't that hard as they make it sound, if you're a
    developer, arch linux is pretty manageable.
  </p>

    Stage 8 - Hate Windows? low disk/ram space? I have a solution
  </h2>

  <p>
    Of course, me alone using linux wasn't fun. So i started getting my friends
    interested in it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I made a few of them switch and now i am the linux tech support till they
    get adjusted to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although i use arch linux and used Ubuntu, I recommend fedora for beginners
    since its a good middle ground between those two.
  </p>

  <h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    I use Arch btw<br />Had to go through all that just to tell the above line
    XD. The journey wasn't easy but the destination is definitely worth it.<br />If
    i have piqued your interest in linux, do consider trying it. You wont regret
    it. As chat GPT puts it "Linux is more than just an operating system â€” it's
    a realm of continuous exploration."
