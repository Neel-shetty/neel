  <h1>The magic on webRTC: video communication made easy</h1>
  <p id="time"></p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    WebRTC is an open-source project that enables real-time communication
    between browsers and mobile applications through a simple set of APIs. It
    stands for &quot;Web Real-Time Communication&quot; and has become a popular
    technology used in various applications, including video conferencing, voice
    calling, and file sharing. Many popular apps such as Discord and Google Meet
    use WebRTC to enable high-quality real-time communication between users. By
    leveraging its peer-to-peer connection, WebRTC offers efficient
    communication, low latency, and secure communication. Let&#39;s take a
    closer look at how this technology works
  </p>
  <p>
    In this blog, we will go over how a WebRTC works from a layman&#39;s
    perspective and a technical perspective. Finally, we will implement a basic
    messaging feature using webRTC.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-method-behind-the-madness">The Method Behind The Madness</h2>
  <p>
    Let&#39;s explain it in layman&#39;s terms first for the non-technical folks
    reading this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine you have 2 friends A and B, but A and B are not friends. You three
    plan to go to a movie. Unfortunately, you are busy with some work and
    can&#39;t coordinate between A and B to choose the place and time to book
    the tickets. So what would you do in this situation?
  </p>
  <p>If you were WebRTC you would</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Ask A if they want to talk to B.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You take A&#39;s phone number/ Instagram id or any other way someone can
        connect with A.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You will tell B that A wants to connect with him and share A&#39;s
        contact details.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You will take B&#39;s contact details and share them with A.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A reaches out to B via his preferred contact method, let&#39;s say
        WhatsApp.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A and B start talking and sharing their ideal location and schedule, and
        book tickets accordingly.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Woohoo, let&#39;s go, you made them communicate with each other without you
    being there.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-technical-wizardry-of-webrtc">
    The Technical Wizardry of WebRTC
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let&#39;s look at the points mentioned in the previous section in a simple
    way.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A wants to connect to B.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A finds out all the possible ways someone can connect to it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>B finds out all possible ways someone can connect to it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A and B signal this session information via other means. Ex- WhatsApp,
        server.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A connects to B via the most optimal path.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A and B also exchange their support media and security.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="the-core-concepts-of-webrtc">The core concepts of WebRTC</h3>
  <p>
    Before understanding how WebRTC establishes a between 2 devices, we need to
    know a few networking topics.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>NAT - Network Address Translation</strong></p>
      <p>
        NAT is the process by which multiple private IP addresses in a local
        network are mapped to a single public IP address before communicating
        with the Internet.<br />
        Here is a diagram to explain how it handles requests when you go to a
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        ![](<a
          href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682698756273/d087e1f2-6483-4f49-9d9d-c8db2dab35c5.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682698756273/d087e1f2-6483-4f49-9d9d-c8db2dab35c5.png</a>
        align=&quot;center&quot;)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different types of NAT but let&#39;s not go in too deep about
        it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>STUN - Session Traversal Utilities for NAT</strong></p>
      <p>
        Since your device uses NAT to interact with the internet, it does not
        know its public IP address. It&#39;s just a simple server that sends you
        your public IP address as the response. Google offers many free STUN
        servers since it&#39;s cheap to maintain. You can host one on your own
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ![](<a
          href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682699731101/3be7a242-e029-4a8f-8910-73fded3b59eb.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682699731101/3be7a242-e029-4a8f-8910-73fded3b59eb.png</a>

        align=&quot;center&quot;)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>TURN - Traversal Using Relays around NAT</strong></p>
      <p>
        TURN is used where STUN cannot be used. If you have a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation#:~:text=to%20hAddr%3AhPort.-,Symmetric%20NAT,a%20different%20mapping%20is%20used.">Symmetric
          NAT</a>
        STUN cannot be used. TURN servers have to pass the data through them to
        the 2nd device, hence this is expensive to maintain.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>ICE - Interactive Connectivity Establishment</strong></p>
      <p>
        An ICE candidate collects all available candidates such as the local IP
        addresses, and STUN addresses. All the collected addresses are then sent
        to the 2nd device via SDP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>SDP - Session Description Protocol</strong><br />
        It is a data format that describes ice candidates, networking options,
        media options, security options, and other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        We generate an SDP for a device and send it to the 2nd device through
        any means(WhatsApp, server, QR code, Twitter). SDP is just a string.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>SDP Signaling</strong></p>
      <p>Sending the SDP to the other device is called signaling</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="how-webrtc-establishes-the-connection">
    How WebRTC establishes the connection
  </h3>
  <p>
    With the new concepts we just learned, we can describe the steps we
    discussed previously in a better way.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A wants to connect to B.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A creates an &quot;offer&quot;, it finds all ICE candidates and other
        stuff and generates the SDP, The offer is the SDP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A signals the offer to B through any means.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>B creates the &quot;answer&quot; after setting A&#39;s offer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>B signals the offer to A through any means.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A and B are now connected.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Once the connection is established, we can share anything over the
    connection. Such as text, video, voice, files, etc.
  </p>
  <h3 id="implementing-a-basic-webrtc-chat">
    Implementing a basic WebRTC chat
  </h3>
  <p>
    The WebRTC API is already available in your browser, you don&#39;t have to
    install any packages.<br />Let&#39;s start by opening two empty browser
    windows side by side and opening the console.
  </p>
  <p>
    ![](<a
      href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682752360222/5ac9340a-3c32-438d-9c1c-da0b731db802.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682752360222/5ac9340a-3c32-438d-9c1c-da0b731db802.png</a>
    align=&quot;center&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>
    now, let&#39;s create a local connection peer and a remote connection peer
    using the RTCPeerConnection.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">// in first console
      const localConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()

      // in second console
      const remoteConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    next, we will create a callback function that will print out the SDP every
    time a new ICE candidate is generated.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">// in first console
      localConnection.onicecandidate = e =&gt; {
      console.log(&quot; NEW ice candidate!! on localconnection reprinting SDP &quot; )
      console.log(JSON.stringify(localConnection.localDescription))
      }

      // in second console
      remoteConnection.onicecandidate = e =&gt; {
      console.log(&quot; NEW ice candidate!! on localconnection reprinting SDP &quot; )
      console.log(JSON.stringify(remoteConnection.localDescription) )
      }
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    Next, we create a data channel using which we can send and receive messages.
    Then we add a callback function to print out the message we receive. and
    print when the connection is opened and closed.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">// in the first console
      const sendChannel = localConnection.createDataChannel(&quot;sendChannel&quot;);

      sendChannel.onmessage = e =&gt; console.log(&quot;messsage received!!!&quot; + e.data )
      sendChannel.onopen = e =&gt; console.log(&quot;open!!!!&quot;);
      sendChannel.onclose =e =&gt; console.log(&quot;closed!!!!!!&quot;);
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    then we create an offer, which is an SDP to send to the remoteConnection.
    and set that offer as the local description, which basically means the local
    user.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">localConnection.createOffer().then(o =&gt;
      localConnection.setLocalDescription(o))
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    you will see the SDP printed on your console after this. You need to copy
    the object you see below and set it as the offer in the remoteConnection
    using any means since both are on the same computer we can just copy and
    paste.
  </p>
  <p>
    ![](<a
      href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682753313663/5182fc1b-057a-49a2-87f9-977e2245a4c7.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682753313663/5182fc1b-057a-49a2-87f9-977e2245a4c7.png</a>
    align=&quot;center&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>in the second console,</p>
  <p>
    ![](<a
      href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682753876395/8164b4e1-c7d4-4fe8-91d2-772463e2e11c.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682753876395/8164b4e1-c7d4-4fe8-91d2-772463e2e11c.png</a>
    align=&quot;center&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>
    then we create a data channel and callback functions like we previously did
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">remoteConnection.ondatachannel= e =&gt; {
      const receiveChannel = e.channel;
      receiveChannel.onmessage =e =&gt; console.log(&quot;messsage received!!!&quot; + e.data )
      receiveChannel.onopen = e =&gt; console.log(&quot;open!!!!&quot;);
      receiveChannel.onclose =e =&gt; console.log(&quot;closed!!!!!!&quot;);
      remoteConnection.channel = receiveChannel;

      }
    </code></pre>
  <p>Then we set the offer as the remote description in the second console.</p>
  <pre><code
      class="language-javascript">remoteConnection.setRemoteDescription(offer).then(a=&gt;console.log(&quot;done&quot;))
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    you will see the answer SDP, copy it and paste it into the first console.
  </p>
  <p>
    ![](<a

    align=&quot;center&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>then we set the answer as the remote description.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">localConnection.setRemoteDescription
      (answer).then(a=&gt;console.log(&quot;done&quot;))
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    now, you will see this on your console, it means that the connection is
    established between both the consoles.
  </p>
  <p>
    ![](<a
      href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682754951776/14f92360-3583-49a7-9223-e6dc4177d6f2.png">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682754951776/14f92360-3583-49a7-9223-e6dc4177d6f2.png</a>

  <p>
    Now you know how WebRTC works under the hood and can use it confidently!
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, we learnt how WebRTC works from both a layman&#39;s
    perspective and a technical perspective. Additionally, we learnt how to
    implement a basic WebRTC chat using the WebRTC API already available in
    modern browsers. Overall, WebRTC has become a popular technology that is
    changing the way we communicate online.
