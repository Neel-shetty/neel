    <h1>A beginners guide to become a developer</h1>
    <p id="time"></p>
    <p>
      Programming is one of the most in-demand skills in today&#39;s job market,
      with a wide range of career opportunities available in fields such as web
      development, mobile app development, data science, and more. However,
      becoming a programmer can seem like a daunting task, especially if you have
      no prior experience in coding. In this article, we&#39;ll break down the
      steps you need to take to become a programmer, from getting started with
      your PC to landing your first programming job.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-0-get-comfortable-with-your-pc">
      Step 0: Get Comfortable with Your PC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before you can start learning to program, you need to be comfortable using
      your PC for everything. This means learning its features, such as navigating
      files and folders, using basic keyboard shortcuts, and working with
      different software programs. If you&#39;re not comfortable using a computer,
      getting into development might take you longer comparatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would recommend you replace your phone with your PC for most of the tasks
      you perform throughout the day. You need to be a consumer first before you
      start developing for it.

    <h2 id="step-1-learn-a-programming-language">
      Step 1: Learn a Programming Language
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first step to becoming a programmer is to choose a programming language
      to learn. Two of the most popular programming languages are Python and
      JavaScript. Python is a great language for beginners because it&#39;s easy
      to learn, has a simple syntax, and is used in a variety of industries,
      including web development, data science, and machine learning. JavaScript is
      also a great language to learn because it&#39;s widely used in web
      development and can be used on both the front-end(visual part) and
      back-end(logical part) of websites.

    </p>
    <h2 id="step-2-build-projects">Step 2: Build Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Once you&#39;ve learned the basics of a programming language, it&#39;s time
      to start building projects. This is where you&#39;ll really start to improve
      your skills and learn how to solve real-world problems with code. Start with
      small projects, like building a calculator or a simple game, and gradually
      work your way up to more complex projects such as a life-changing alarm app
      XD.

    </p>
    <h2 id="step-3-watch-programming-videos">Step 3: Watch Programming Videos</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of programming videos available on YouTube, covering
      everything from basic programming concepts to advanced algorithms. Watch as
      many videos as you can to gain a better understanding of programming and
      learn new techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing here is to get involved in the community and keep
      yourself updated with the new developments. This is pretty fun too, I would
      personally recommend you to check out
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">Theo</a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen">The Primeagen&#39;s</a>
      Channel for some entertaining and insightful tech content.

    </p>
    <h2 id="step-4-decide-on-your-path">Step 4: Decide on Your Path</h2>
    <p>
      At this point, you&#39;ll need to decide if you want to specialize in a
      particular area of programming, like web development, etc, or if you want to
      focus on more theoretical topics like data structures and algorithms. This
      decision will help you determine which skills to prioritize in your learning
      journey.

      Hackathons are events where programmers come together to work on projects
      and solve problems in a collaborative environment. Participating in
      hackathons can help you improve your skills, meet other programmers, and
      even land a job.
