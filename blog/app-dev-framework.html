  <h1>Choosing the right app development framework: A comprehensive guide</h1>
  <p id="time"></p>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    If you are reading this article, chances are you either want to create an
    app for your business or are interested in becoming an app developer. In
    this piece, we will discuss the major framework options available for mobile
    app development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let us examine the major framework options available. I am using the
    term &quot;framework&quot; in a broad sense, but I trust that my meaning is
    clear.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Native Android - Runs exclusively on Android.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Native iOS - Runs exclusively on iOS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>React Native - Runs on both Android and iOS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Flutter - Runs on both Android and iOS.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    When starting a business, time to market is crucial. Consequently,
    developing two separate apps or hiring two distinct teams for native Android
    and native iOS can be both costly and time-intensive. Opting for either
    React Native or Flutter might prove more advantageous for enterprises. React
    Native, in particular, is a favored option as it is simpler to engage
    developers who possess proficiency in JavaScript, and the accompanying
    ecosystem is a significant asset. Although it is worth noting that Flutter
    boasts superior performance to React Native, this is among the leading
    reasons why it is gaining popularity.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>, a popular
    Twitter alternative, was built using React Native. They launched on the web,
    Android, and iOS simultaneously, showcasing the real benefits of hybrid
    frameworks.

    Choosing a framework as a developer can be challenging. To help make the
    decision easier, consider your goals and pick the framework that best suits
    you. Here&#39;s a breakdown of each option
  </p>
  <h3 id="native-android">Native Android</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to get hired quickly and have more opportunities, Native Android
    is still the most popular choice. It also lacks the extra complications that
    come with hybrid frameworks.
  </p>
  <h3 id="native-ios">Native iOS</h3>
  <p>
    Choosing Native iOS might be a smart move as there isn&#39;t much
    competition in this field to get hired. Also, the purchasing power of iOS
    users is comparatively higher, so consider this factor if you are unsure
    between Native iOS and Android.
  </p>
  <h3 id="react-native">React Native</h3>
  <p>
    If you are familiar with web development or want to get into web development
    in the future, React Native is an excellent option. It is a popular
    framework that comes with the benefit of hybrid nature and JavaScript,
    making it a popular choice for freelancers.
  </p>
  <h3 id="flutter">Flutter</h3>
  <p>
    Flutter is a relatively new, performant alternative to React Native, and its
    adoption is growing over time. It might be a good idea to learn Flutter to
    be future-proof. Learning both Flutter and React Native can increase the
    number of projects you can undertake as a freelancer.
